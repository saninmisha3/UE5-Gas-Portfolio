## Key Features

### Gameplay Ability System (GAS) Implementation
- **Modular Ability Framework**: Every weapon, action, and power-up is built using GAS for reusability and balance.
- **Attribute-Based Damage & Health System**: Player stats, buffs, and debuffs dynamically managed through GAS.
- **Gameplay Effects & Gameplay Cues**: Visual and audio feedback tied directly to ability activations and status effects.

### Advanced AI & Combat Mechanics
- **AI Utilizing GAS**: Enemies use abilities, react to player actions, and adapt their strategies.
- **Dynamic Combat System**: AI opponents engage in strategic combat using GAS-driven abilities.
- **State-Based AI Behavior**: Uses Gameplay Tags to determine enemy states, actions, and reactions.

### Multiplayer-Ready Gameplay
- **GAS-Driven Replication**: Networked abilities, status effects, and player stats synchronized in real time.
- **Team-Based Match System**: Seamless integration of competitive team-based modes.
- **Optimized Ability Execution**: Designed with client-server authority in mind for lag-free interactions.

### Immersive UI & HUD
- **Ability Cooldowns & Status Effects**: GAS-integrated UI elements for real-time feedback.
- **Dynamic Combat Interface**: Displays ammo, health, and active abilities with smooth animations.

### Stunning Visuals & Audio
- **Niagara-Enhanced VFX**: Abilities trigger high-quality visual effects using the Niagara system.
- **Cinematic Camera Work**: Adaptive post-processing effects for combat intensity.
- **Spatialized 3D Sound**: Every ability and weapon interaction features high-fidelity sound cues.
